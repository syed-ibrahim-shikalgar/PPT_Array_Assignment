ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

Given an arrayÂ **arr[ ]**Â of sizeÂ **N**Â havingÂ elements, theÂ task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 4, arr[] = [1 3 2 4]
Output:
3 4 4 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element
to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 ?
since it doesn't exist, it is -1.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N = 5, arr[] [6 8 0 1 3]
Output:
8 -1 1 3 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element to
6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements
hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it
is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger
element on right and hence -1.

function nextGreaterElement(arr) {
  const result = [];
  const stack = [];

  // Iterate over the array from right to left
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // Pop elements from the stack that are smaller than or equal to the current element
    while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] <= arr[i]) {
      stack.pop();
    }

    // If stack is empty, there is no greater element to the right
    if (stack.length === 0) {
      result.unshift(-1);
    } else {
      // The top element of the stack is the next greater element
      result.unshift(stack[stack.length - 1]);
    }

    // Push the current element to the stack
    stack.push(arr[i]);
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
const arr1 = [1, 3, 2, 4];
console.log(nextGreaterElement(arr1)); // Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]

const arr2 = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3];
console.log(nextGreaterElement(arr2)); // Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
